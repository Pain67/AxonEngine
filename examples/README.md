# Examples

## Install

First of all, build your Axon Engine. You should get .dll/.lib for Windows target platform and .a/.so for UNIX systems. 
Modify CMakeLists.txt if you have your build stored in custom directory.

## Building

Building example:

```bash
	mkdir cmake-build
	cd cmake-build

	cmake .. && cmake --build .
```
